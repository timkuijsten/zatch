.Nd efficiently watch directory changes on macOS
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl Vhpqsv
.Ar dir ...
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
efficiently watches directory changes on macOS.
It does this by coalescing all changes in a directory that happen within 30 ms
and echo a line on stdout to indicate that one or more things changed in that
directory or any of it's subdirectories.
A trailing slash on the echoed directory names is ensured.
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl V
Print version and exit.
.It Fl h
Print usage and exit.
.It Fl p
Preflight - echo the name of each dir on the command line once before starting
to monitor.
.It Fl q
Be less verbose.
Can be used multiple times.
.It Fl s
Show subdirs to narrow down where a change occurred.
Since all changes within 30 ms are coalesced, some changes might have occurred
in a subdirectory of the one that is echoed.
.It Fl v
Be more verbose.
Can be used multiple times.
.It Ar dir
One or more directories to watch.
A trailing slash is appended if not already specified before echoing
.Ar dir
to
.Dv stdout .
